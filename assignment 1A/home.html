            Hi! I'm Parizaa, a second year B.Tech student at <b>VIT Vellore</b> studying Computer Science Engineering. I grew up in <span style="color:rgb(0, 195, 255)">Bangalore</span> and did my entire schooling from Presidency School. Picking Computer as a subject in 11th grade opened my eyes to how <mark>fascinating</mark> coding can be, which made me pursue this degree. Apart from CS, I really enjoy subjects which make use of logical thinking, especially Math and Physics. I also have quite a bit of creativity, which I wanted to combine with tech, so I started <u>learning basics of UI/UX</u>. As an active member at <b>IEEE-CS VIT</b>, I've been able to extensively work using <em>Figma</em>, helping me blend creativity with technology.

            Apart from academics, I spend my free time pursuing my <b><u>hobbies</u></b>. Some of them are:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color:rgb(18, 127, 1)">Reading novels</span> 
                <ol><li>The Kite Runner</li>
                    <li>The Book Thief</li>
                    <li>Metamorphosis</li>
                    <li>The Bell Jar</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span style="color:rgb(18, 127, 1)">Watching movies</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Midsommar</li>
                        <li>Parasite</li>
                        <li>Spiderman</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Skating</li>
                <li>Playing badminton</li>
                <li>Going to parks</li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Drawing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Looking ahead, I'm <i>excited</i> about learning much more in CS while staying true to my fun-loving and <i>adventurous</i> side. My aspirations include not just <u>excelling</u> in academics but also crossing things off of my <em>bucket list</em>, like travelling across all 7 continents, and skydiving. I also aim to leave a lasting impact. For me, the journey is about <span style="background-color:rgb(153, 233, 252)">living with passion and making every moment count</span>.
